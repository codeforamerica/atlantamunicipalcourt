## Municipal Court of Atlanta 2015 Warrant Amnesty Program

#### What is warrant amnesty?
For a limited time only the Municipal Court of Atlanta is offering warrant amnesty as a goodwill gesture to individuals who face arrest and other penalties due to a past failure to appear (FTA) at court.  Under the program outstanding warrants issued before November 18, 2014 will be set aside and the associated contempt fees will be waived, thereby allowing  individuals to resolve their outstanding court case.   

#### Why is the court doing this now?
The Municipal Court of Atlanta has thousands of active warrants it is seeking to clear. Now is the time for citizens to take advantage of the warrant set aside and resolve all delinquent court cases. Once the amnesty period ends the City of Atlanta will aggressively enforce all active warrants.  Citizens are encouraged to contact the court immediately in order to avoid arrest in the future. 

#### When does the amnesty period begin?
The eight week amnesty period is February 2, 2015 through March 27, 2015.  Court hours of operation are Monday – Friday, 7am – 5:30pm.
