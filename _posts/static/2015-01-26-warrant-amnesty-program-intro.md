# Warrant Amnesty Program
## What is warrant amnesty?

For a limited time only the Municipal Court of Atlanta is offering warrant amnesty as a 
goodwill gesture to individuals who face arrest and other penalties due to a past failure to appear (FTA) at court.  

Under the program outstanding warrants issued before <b>November 18, 2014</b> will be cancelled and the contempt fee will be waived, thereby allowing individuals to resolve their outstanding court case. <a href="http://court.atlantaga.gov/warrant-amnesty-info/">More...</a>
