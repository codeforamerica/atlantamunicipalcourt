# Teen Learning Control Program

## Background

Dear Young Driver,

Welcome to Teens Learning Control (TLC)! The TLC Program is aimed at young drivers age 20 and under who are convicted of various driving offenses ranging from a broken tail light to driving under the influence, as well as any other offenses at the Court's discretion. Unfortunately, automobile accidents are the leading cause of death among young people. The goal of the TLC Program is to educate you and prevent negative driving behaviors in the future. The program also attempts to provide fundamental skills that can be applied to all areas of life.

Depending on your particular traffic offense(s), you will be placed in one of the five TLC Modules. Each module has different requirements including some combination of educational videos, exams, driver's educational classes, interactive peer groups, seminars and community service.

**YOU MUST REGISTER FOR THE PROGRAM WITHIN 72 HOURS OF SENTENCING**
