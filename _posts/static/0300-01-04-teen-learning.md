# Tean Learning Control Program

## Background

Dear Young Driver,

Welcome to Teens Learning Control (TLC)! TLC is aimed at young drivers age 20 and under who are convicted of various driving offenses ranging from a broken taillight to driving under the influence, as well as any other offenses at the Court's discretion. Unfortunately, automobiles accidents are the leading cause of death among young people. The goal of the TLC program is to educate you and prevent negative driving behaviors in the future. The program also attempts to provide you with life skills that can be applied to all areas of living.

Depending on your particular traffic offense(s), you will be placed in one of the five TLC Modules. Each module has different requirements including some combination of educational videos, exams, driver's educational classes, interactive peer groups, seminars, and community service.

Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the Municipal Court of Atlanta TLC staff. The contact info is listed to the right of this page.
