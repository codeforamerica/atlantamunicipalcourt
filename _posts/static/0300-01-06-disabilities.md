Requests for assistance can be made by either contacting the Ombudsman Unit at (404) 954-6767 or in-person at any of the information windows on the courtâ€™s main floor. If attending court, requests for assistance may be made to courtroom staff (please see a Case Manager).

If you prefer to make a request before your appearance, please see the attached form.
