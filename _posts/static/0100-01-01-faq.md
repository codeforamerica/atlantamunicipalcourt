# Municipal Court of Atlanta 
# 2015 Warrant Amnesty Program

## 
## **What is warrant amnesty?**
For a limited time the Municipal Court of Atlanta is offering warrant amnesty as a goodwill gesture to individuals who face arrest and other penalties due to a past failure to appear (FTA) at court.  Under the program outstanding warrants issued before <b>November 18, 2014</b> will be cancelled and the contempt fee will be waived, thereby allowing individuals to resolve their outstanding court case.

The eight week amnesty period will run from February 2, 2015 through March 27, 2015.

If you are an out of state driver you may be eligible to enter a plea in abstentia. If you are still unsure you should contact the court about your case before the schedule court date.

## Can I change my court date?

In some instances it is possible to change your court date. You can write a letter stating why you cannot make your court appearance, and ask for a new court date. You can submit the letter up to two (2) days before your court date to the clerk's office at the Municipal Court of Atlanta, 150 Garnett Street, SW Atlanta, GA 30303. Please keep in mind, that the court is not obligated to grant your new court date request. It is your responsibility to contact the clerk's office to find out if your request for a new court date has been granted.

## What should I do if I miss my court date?

Missing your court date is a serious offense. If you miss your court date for either a criminal or traffic citation, you are in failure to appear (FTA) status and a bench warrant will be issued for your arrest. In addition, your driverâ€™s license will be suspended (see [additional circumstances below](#fta)). If you are pulled over by an officer, you will be arrested.

To get a new court date, come to the courthouse between 8am-3pm, Monday-Thursday. You may be charged an FTA fee for missing your original court date. If you have a valid medical excuse or documentation of being incarcerated, bring evidence to your new court date to have the fee removed.

# At Court

## What should I do on my court date?

*Arrive early.* You should plan to arrive early for your case to compensate for any unexpected delays. Once you arrive in court, you will pass through a mandatory security check before being allowed to enter.

*Identify your court room.* To locate the court room where you case will be heard, find the defendant's name on one of the information screens in the main lobby. You can also ask at the information windows located in the main lobby. 

*Proceed to your courtroom.* Courtrooms are located on the 1st (one floor down from the entrance), 3rd, 5th and 6th floors. Elevators are located to the left of the information windows in the main lobby. There is also a staircase near the security station in the main lobby.

*Check in with courtroom staff.* Each courtroom has staff that can give you more information about your case. Check in with them to learn more about what will be required of you. Be advised that court staff, solicitors and the Judge cannot give you legal advice. Please consult an attorney or a [public defender](/publicdefender) if you have a legal question regarding your case.

*Turn off your phone and other electronic devices.* Remain attentive and do not disturb court proceedings. There may be other cases heard in the same court room that you have been assigned. 

## What are the possible outcomes of my case?

If you enter a guilty plea or a nolo contendere plea you will be required to satisfy the ruling of the court. This may include paying a fine, payable by cash, debit, or credit card. Some offenses can also result in jail time, including mandatory jail time under certain circumstances. 

If you request a jury trial, your case will be turned over to [Fulton County Court](http://www.fultoncourt.org/). If found not guilty after trial your case is closed. 

Your case may also be reset for a future date.

# After Court

## <a name="fta"></a>  What happens if my license is suspended because of a Failure to Appear (FTA)?

You will need to appear in court to clear your FTA. After disposition of your case, you will need to reinstate your license at the Department of Driver Services (DDS) using [this online form](https://online.dds.ga.gov/OnlineServices/SSIntro.aspx).

If the court has issued a warrant for your arrest based on the FTA you are at risk of arrest until the warrant has been cleared by the Judge that issued the Warrant.
