## What should I do if I miss my court date?

Missing your court date is a serious offense. If you miss your court date for either a criminal or traffic citation, you are in failure to appear (FTA) status and a bench warrant will be issued for your arrest. In addition, your driverâ€™s license will be suspended (see [additional circumstances below](#fta)). If you are pulled over by an officer, you will be arrested.

**The Municipal Court offers special FTA dockets each day at 9a and 1p.** To be added to one of these dockets, come to the courthouse no later than 8a for the 9a docket and no later than noon for the 1p docket, Monday-Friday. Early arrival is strongly recommended because of limited capacity.

You may be charged an FTA fee for missing your original court date. If you have a valid medical excuse or documentation of being incarcerated, bring evidence to your new court date to have the fee removed.

# Before Court

## When is my court date?

# At Court

## What should I do on my court date?

*Arrive early.* You should plan to arrive early for your case to compensate for any unexpected delays. Once you arrive in court, you will pass through a mandatory security check before being allowed to enter.

*Identify your court room.* To locate the court room where you case will be heard, find the defendant's name on one of the information screens in the main lobby. You can also ask at the information windows located in the main lobby. 

*Proceed to your courtroom.* Courtrooms are located on the 1st (one floor down from the entrance), 3rd, 5th and 6th floors. Elevators are located to the left of the information windows in the main lobby. There is also a staircase near the security station in the main lobby.

*Check in with courtroom staff.* Each courtroom has staff that can give you more information about your case. Check in with them to learn more about what will be required of you. Be advised that court staff, solicitors and the Judge cannot give you legal advice. Please consult an attorney or a [public defender](/publicdefender) if you have a legal question regarding your case.

*Turn off your phone and other electronic devices.* Remain attentive and do not disturb court proceedings. There may be other cases heard in the same court room that you have been assigned. 

## What are the possible outcomes of my case?

If you enter a guilty plea or a nolo contendere plea you will be required to satisfy the ruling of the court. This may include paying a fine, payable by cash, debit, or credit card. Some offenses can also result in jail time, including mandatory jail time under certain circumstances. You can also be ordered to complete community service or educational programs at the discretion of the judge.

Your case may also be reset for a future date.

# After Court

## <a name="fta"></a>  What happens if my license is suspended because of a Failure to Appear (FTA)?

You will need to appear in court to clear your FTA. After disposition of your case, you will need to reinstate your license at the Department of Driver Services (DDS) using <a href="https://online.dds.ga.gov/OnlineServices/SSIntro.aspx" target="_blank">this online form</a>.

If the court has issued a warrant for your arrest based on the FTA you are at risk of arrest until the warrant has been cleared by the Judge that issued the Warrant.
