## What should I do if I miss my court date?

Missing your court date is a serious offense. If you miss your court date for either a criminal or traffic citation, you are in failure to appear (FTA) status and a bench warrant will be issued for your arrest. In addition, your driverâ€™s license will be suspended (see [additional circumstances below](#fta)). If you are pulled over by an officer, you will be arrested.

**The Municipal Court offers special FTA dockets Monday-Friday at 8a and 1p. Doors open at 7a daily. Early arrival is strongly recommended because of limited capacity.**

If you are an out of state driver and you need to schedule a time to resolve your FTA please submit your request [here](http://www.atl311.com/?page_id=115&atlId=1-HQEVE&_crauth=0f1b76975e).

You may be charged an FTA fee for missing your original court date. If you have a valid medical excuse or documentation of being incarcerated, bring evidence to your new court date.
