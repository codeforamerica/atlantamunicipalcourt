# Court Programs

## Overview

Municipal Court of Atlanta’s Community Court responds to what are known as quality of life crimes: prostitution, disorderly conduct, panhandling and low-level drug offenses. Community Court is committed to the dual principles of restorative justice and rehabilitation. Restorative Justice promotes the idea that the criminal justice system can better serve the community by using alternative sentencing options, such as community service, to allow individuals charged with low-level offenses “to give something back” to their community.

Community Court takes a nontraditional approach to working with offenders, using sentencing alternatives and legal sanctions to promote rehabilitation and address the underlying causes of criminality. The Court maintains that it has a clear interest, both ethical and financial, in seeing to it that offenders receive services that will help curb future criminal behavior.

Defendants can be referred to Community Court from a number of sources, including the Municipal Court Judges, Office of the Public Defender, Office of the City Solicitor, Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) Officers and Detention Center staff.

Community Court represents the combined efforts of the criminal justice system, local governments, non-profit agencies and the private sector. The leadership provided by Judge Clinton Deveaux and Judge Crystal Gaines along with the dedication and participation of other city departments, agencies and service providers make Community Court work. Community Court greatly values its partnerships with county, state, private and non-profit agencies which provide treatment services to the Court’s defendants.

Community Court is managed through the Office of Court Programs. The Office oversees Community Court programs, services and classes.

## Teens Learning Control (TLC)

TLC is for young drivers between 17 and 21 who are convicted of various driving offenses and possession charges. The program includes innovative tactics designed to educate and deter future negative driving behaviors and substance usage. TLC also provides lessons in decision-making that can be applied to all areas of life.

## Restorative Justice Boards

The Restorative Boards are composed of concerned residents in the City of Atlanta who are interested in repairing and restoring the harmful effects that crime has caused in their community by working with those who commit those crimes. The program participants are usually young first-time offenders needing to address issues of education, employment, some drug use, anger issues, etc.

The Restorative Board members identify the needs of the participant, recommend sanctions to the Court, and monitor the completion of those sanctions. The goal is to reconnect the participants to the community through the guidance and mentoring of Board members and through participation in community service projects. 

## Clinical Services

Through Clinical Services, defendants are assessed for mental health and substance addiction issues. If the defendant chooses the treatment option, an appropriate treatment provider is identified, and the defendant enters the treatment program. The defendant is monitored and the case is managed until treatment requirements are met and the case is dismissed.

## Community Service

Community Service strengthens communities by reconnecting offenders with local residents through positive work projects and encourages smaller neighborhoods to organize and address crime problems by partnering with the criminal justice system. Additionally, as an alternative to incarceration, community service allows the Court to move low-level offenders out the of the criminal justice system, freeing up costly jail space for those charged with more serious offenses. 

## Veterans Assistance 

Defendants identified as veterans are assisted in connecting to services through the Veterans’ Administration. The VA assists the defendants with addiction issues, housing and employment.

## Restorative Justice

Restorative justice is a response to crime that focuses on holding the offender accountable for the harm they have caused and building peace within communities. It provides offenders an opportunity to tangibly and symbolically reimburse the community for some of the damage they have caused as they perform visible, meaningful community service within the community. Citizens see the offender as an individual working for rather than against the community. Restorative justice restores communities by allowing the offender to contribute labor or talent to valuable and visible community projects and prove his/her worth as a member of the community therefore regaining acceptance by its citizens. 

## Restorative Justice Center

The mission of Restorative Board Justice Center and the Restorative Justice Board is to provide funding streams and grant assistance for many of the existing court programs and help develop others. For more information about the Restorative Justice Center, click here.
